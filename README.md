# ROS_end_effector

code developed to steer a robotic arm using a 3DMouse that steers the end effector. The end effector was equipped with an Elcometer ultrasonic layer thickness sensor which automatically would report measurements on USB when a valid measurement could be made. A portable user interface (pui) was part of the project. It had two 3Dmice, a touchscreen etc. It would send commands over WIFI packiging them with protobuf. The robot ran linux with ROS hydro medusa. This repo is just a selection of the system.
